# Mastermind-Canvas project overview

A couple years ago I was sorting my childhood games out, then I stumbled upon a Super Mastermind a friend of my parents' gifted to me while I was a little kid.
At that time it had not been really appreciated, but when I rediscovered it, it struck me as :
1. a really good model for scientific experiments : you make an hypothesis, then you design an experiment to test it, then you analyze the results. Rinse, repeat.
2. a really poor board game for two : while one player is having fun breaking the code, the other one has the role of a (unreliable) robot.


## What is it ? (and why the funny name ?)

A great deal of work was directed at abstracting the game away from the vast diversity of ["Look and Feel"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_and_feel), thus
the "foundation code" can be used, with limited changes, to produce a large range of variants, while being as platform-agnostic as possible (computer or mobile phone, typically).

Since you cannot make anything else with it, it qualifies neither as a toolbox nor a framework... it is more like a bootstrap project, with a quite rigid skeleton...
But in creative hands, who knows ?
